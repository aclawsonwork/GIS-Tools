# GIS-Tools
The GIS-Tools package is a python package designed for preprocessing GIS imagery datasets. 
It uses the arcpy python library from ESRI to convert mask raster images by geographical boundaries,
Convert those rasters to polygons, and write them to the SDE database. All of the operations are
designed around file / database / geodatabase operations on the BUSHEL server. Additionally, the
package is tightly coupled with the arcpy Python package.
